## [Unreleased] (after v0.4.3)

Post-v0.4.3 work on `main` that has not yet been tagged.

### Security Hardening

- **Strict git pack**: expanded dangerous-command detection for additional destructive git patterns ([6d950f3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/6d950f3), [031e84a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/031e84a))
- Removed safe patterns in strict git pack that created a compound-command bypass ([d6ce202](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/d6ce202))
- Podman `rm`/`rmi` combined-flag bypass (e.g. `podman rm -af`) ([d9d23b5](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/d9d23b5))

### Hook & Agent Detection

- **Codex CLI PreToolUse hook support**: Codex CLI now fully supported via experimental `~/.codex/hooks.json` PreToolUse hooks. The wire format is compatible with Claude Code's `hookSpecificOutput` protocol, so no new protocol variant was needed. The installer auto-configures `~/.codex/hooks.json` when Codex CLI is detected. Closes [#84](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/issues/84).
- Hook system expansion with additional interception patterns and strict git pack hardening ([031e84a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/031e84a))
- Disambiguate Claude Code from Gemini in `detect_protocol()` -- closes [#77](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/issues/77) ([8815b54](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/8815b54))

### Maintenance

- Clippy and rustfmt cleanup across CLI, hook, and pack modules ([c26f22d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/c26f22d))
- Test infrastructure: `large_dataset_insertion` test updated to use in-memory DB with manual seeding ([784e356](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/784e356))

## [v0.4.3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.4.3) -- 2026-03-14 [Tag]

A large release adding new agent detections, new protection packs, self-healing settings monitoring, and a session-scoped interactive allowlist system.

### Self-Healing & Resilience

- **Real-time `settings.json` overwrite detection and self-healing** -- DCG now watches for external processes silently removing its hook registration and restores it automatically ([708d202](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/708d202))

## Initial Development -- 2026-01-07

The project began as `git_safety_guard`, a focused tool for blocking destructive git commands. It was renamed to **destructive_command_guard** (`dcg`) and expanded into a general-purpose destructive-command interceptor with the modular pack system.

- Initial commit ([1640612](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/16406128fc967a305b97f4cd8da1b537a4be7b6f))
